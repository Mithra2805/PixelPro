Image Classification Project: [PixelPro]
Project Overview

PixelPro is an image classification project designed to automatically categorize images into predefined classes using machine learning techniques. The project uses deep learning models to identify objects, scenes, or entities within images, making it a valuable tool for various industries such as healthcare, security, and e-commerce.

This repository contains the necessary code and documentation to train, test, and deploy an image classification model using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.

Features
Automatic Image Classification: Classifies images into one or more categories.
Pre-trained Models: Supports pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG, or Inception for transfer learning.
Customizable: Easy to modify for different image datasets and classification tasks.
Model Evaluation: Provides evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up the environment.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installing Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the required libraries using pip.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/[project-name].git
cd [project-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes all necessary libraries, such as:

TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
Pillow
Usage
Training the Model
To start training the image classification model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_dir /path/to/dataset --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
--data_dir: Path to the directory containing your training images.
--epochs: Number of training epochs.
--batch_size: Batch size for training.
Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new images. Run the following command to classify an image:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
--model_path: Path to the trained model file.
--image_path: Path to the image you want to classify.
Example Code
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

# Load the trained model
model = load_model('path/to/saved_model.h5')

# Load and preprocess the image
img_path = 'path/to/image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension
img_array /= 255.0  # Normalize the image

# Make a prediction
predictions = model.predict(img_array)
predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions)

print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
Model Architecture
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model architecture can be customized, but a typical structure includes:

Input layer (with image resizing)
Convolutional layers (with filters and activation functions)
Pooling layers (for downsampling)
Dense fully connected layers
Output layer (with softmax activation for multi-class classification)
You can experiment with different architectures or use transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet50, VGG16, or InceptionV3.

Data Preprocessing
For optimal model performance, image data should be preprocessed, including:

Resizing: Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224).
Normalization: Scale pixel values to the range [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
Augmentation: Optionally, augment the dataset with techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve model generalization.
Example preprocessing pipeline:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, rotation_range=30, width_shift_range=0.2, height_shift_range=0.2, horizontal_flip=True)
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory('data/train', target_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32, class_mode='categorical')
Evaluation
After training the model, it's essential to evaluate its performance. Common evaluation metrics for image classification include:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives.
Confusion Matrix: A table that shows the classification results broken down by each class.
To generate a confusion matrix and other metrics:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Predict the labels on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)

# Compute the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_classes)

# Plot the confusion matrix
plt.matshow(cm, cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

# Classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_classes))
